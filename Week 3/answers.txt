In this exercise we are given 3 compiled programs and told to time them against different data sets to determine which sorting algorithm they use
* Selection Sort (Theta(n squared)))
* Bubble Sort (O(nsquared), Omega(n))
* Merge Sort (Theta(n log n))
===================================
sort1 uses: Bubble Sort?
It's significantly faster on Sorted than Reversed or Random.

How do you know?: (reversed10000 takes .222s) && (sorted5000 takes .039s) && (random10k takes .206s)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort
It's significantly faster than the other two sorts overall

How do you know?: (reversed10000 takes .045s) && (sorted5000 takes .042s) && (random10k takes .042s)

sort3 uses: Selection Sort
Sorting time is about the same on all 3 data sets.
How do you know?: (reversed10000 takes .151s) && (sorted5000 takes .134)s && (random10k takes .169s)
